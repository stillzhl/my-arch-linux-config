# Yazelix v4: A true sidebar opens files in a helix buffer! 

### Overview
Yazelix integrates yazi, zellij and helix, hence the name, get it?
- Zellij orchestrates everything, with yazi as a sidebar and helix as the editor
- You can open and close the sidebar by switching zellij layouts (press `alt ]` and `alt [`)
  - Or if you only got one pane open, make it fullscreen (`ctrl p + f` or `alt f` )
- Every keybinding from zellij that conflicts with helix is remapped (see them at the bottom)
- Helix is called when you hit enter on a file in the "sidebar"
  - If helix is already open, in a pane next to the sidebar, it will open in a new buffer on that pane (magic)
- This project holds my config files for zellij and yazi, almost like a plugin or something
  - But it's just some config files with a bit of shell scripting!

### Preview

### Improvements of the v4 over v3
- ROUNDED CORNERS
- A wish come true: when you hit enter in a file or folder in yazi, if helix is open in a pane next to yazi, it will open in a helix buffer
  - All it took was some shell scripting magic...
  - it will also change your working dir, so when you press `SPACE f` you open the picker in that folder you're actually in
- New-tab layout has improved. Now new panes are just yazi in a 100% width pane, working sort of like a picker.
  - You just open a file or folder from yazi and it goes to it's proper place as a sidebar to the right
- Added a dedicate kb to make panes full screen `alt f`
- The repo was previously called `zellij` so people could just clone it in their `.config` folder directly, but this just sounded off. 
  - The project's name is yazelix, not zellij, after all. So now the repo name is yazelix the way god intended
  - Take a look at the new instructions to set it up just below!
  
<br>

### Instructions to set it up
1. Make sure [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) and [helix](https://helix-editor.com) are installed and in your path
2. Just clone this repo in your `~/.config` dir
3. Set this command to run on your terminal startup (I prefer never leaving zellij): 
  ```bash
  zellij -l welcome --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij options --layout-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layouts
  ```
  or if you don't like the welcome screen: 
  ```bash
  zellij -l ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layouts/yazelix --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij 
  ```
  or if you need to run zellij from your shell because it sets your environment variables (that's what I do and recommend) 
  ```bash
  nu -c "zellij -l welcome --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij options --layout-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layouts" 
  ```
  (this is with nushell, but should be similar for zsh etc)
  - My alacritty files are [here](https://github.com/luccahuguet/alacritty-files) if you'd like to take a look or mercilessly copy them
  - If you like to run zellij on demand, then just run the command once and your shell should autocomplete the command after the first time (good shells like nushell do that)
4. Optional: Using zoxide enhances the yazelix experience ten-fold, let me tell ya... and it integrates with yazi

That's it, and feel free to open issues and PRs ðŸ˜‰

### Why use this project?
- This project is relatively simple to understand, the inner workings and all. Just a bit shell scripting magic, but mostly config files
- Easy to configure and make it yours
- I daily drive this, and will change it according to my needs, keeping it updated and improving it
- Zero conflict keybindings, very powerful sidebar (learning yazi is a process, but you can do very cool stuff)

<br>

### Possible Improvements
- Yazelix will only detect helix if it's adjacent to the sidebar. A minor thing.
- When you open a new tab, yazi opens as single pane taking all space
  - But it does not show the parents and preview columns, it only shows the current dir column
  - To address this I would have to reopen yazi with a different config? 
- The opening of files in a helix buffer implementation works but feels like a workaround. But it does not matter much. Helix will get a plugin system and then a file tree plugin probably between the beginning and middle of 2025 anyaways..

### Keybinding remaps
| New Zellij Keybinding | Previous Keybinding  | Helix Action that uses that previous key | Zellij Action remaped       |
|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ctrl e                | Ctrl o               | jump_backward                            | SwitchToMode "Session"      |
| Ctrl y                | Ctrl s               | save_selection                           | SwitchToMode "Scroll"       |
| Alt w                 | Alt i                | shrink_selection                         | MoveTab "Left"              |
| Alt q                 | Alt o                | expand_selection                         | MoveTab "Right"             |
| Alt m                 | Alt n                | select_next_sibling                      | NewPane                     |
| Alt 2                 | Ctrl b               | move_page_up                             | SwitchToMode "Tmux"         |

If you find a conflict, please open an issue. Keep in mind, though, that compatibility with tmux mode is not a goal of this project.

### Details: Base Layout
The initial layout includes one usable pane (actually 4, counting the tab-bar, status-bar and sidebar):

- **Tab-bar** at the top
- **Status-bar** at the bottom
- **Yazi pane** (20% width) acting as a sidebar on the left
- **Empty pane** on the right

<br>

### Notes
- You can add more swap layouts as needed, using the KDL files in `layouts`.
- I recommend running zellij from your shell (`nu -c "zellij -l welcome"` for nushell). 
  - This way you can load your enviroment variables like EDITOR and HELIX_RUNTIME
- I recommend using alacritty as your terminal
  - because it's a "dumb" terminal, it has no panes, no tabs. This means less keybindings conflicts to worry about, less feature overlap
  - very performant
  - but I do want to explore more modern options, so long as they have a "plain mode", like [this](https://raphamorim.io/rio/pt-br/docs/next/navigation#plain)
  - you can check out my alacritty files [here](https://github.com/luccahuguet/alacritty-files) (they include all alacritty themes)
- Use [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), it's a great shell, it's fast and beautiful and a proper programming language. Why wouldn't you?
- If you test this with nvim and it works, let me know (see the issue [here](https://github.com/luccahuguet/zellij/issues/2))
- Special thanks to yazi's, zellij's and helix's contributors/maintainers!
